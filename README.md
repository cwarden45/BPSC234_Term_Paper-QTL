The *[Bloom et al. 2019](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49212)* *eLife* publication / dataset was selected due the combination of [processed genotype data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/o764opdwcly2cpo061sqc/ACQBKlJPPzo2VS4Marwcr2o?rlkey=y01ub37eysvj0kb6df1dj2swh&e=1&dl=0), [public code](https://github.com/joshsbloom/yeast-16-parents), [raw data deposit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA549760/), and an [earlier preprint discussion](http://disq.us/p/216tpbo).

Other publications / datasets used for general preparatation (for the term project and course content) include *[Gandolfi et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25438-0)* (which has been partially used for earlier analysis of domestic cat Whole Genome Seqeuncing data [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/Bastu_Cat_Genome) and [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/MissYvonne_Cat_Genome)), *[Yengo et al. 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05275-y)* (with a *Disqus* comment, although that is largely independent of the question of sample size and saturation for a quantiative trait across diverse populations), and *[Fei_et_al_2022](https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-022-03470-7)* (with maize SLAF-Seq [raw data deposit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=PRJNA778629)).
