The *[Bloom et al. 2019](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49212)* *eLife* publication / dataset was selected due the combination of [processed genotype data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/o764opdwcly2cpo061sqc/ACQBKlJPPzo2VS4Marwcr2o?rlkey=y01ub37eysvj0kb6df1dj2swh&e=1&dl=0), [public code](https://github.com/joshsbloom/yeast-16-parents), [raw data deposit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA549760/), and an [earlier preprint discussion](http://disq.us/p/216tpbo).

Other publications / datasets used for general preparatation (for the term project and course content) include *[Gandolfi et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25438-0)* (which has been partially used for earlier analysis of domestic cat Whole Genome Sequencing data [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/Bastu_Cat_Genome) and [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/MissYvonne_Cat_Genome), and there is more specific discussion of the genetic map creation/calculation in *[Li et al. 2016](https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/6/6/1607/6029961)*), *[Yengo et al. 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05275-y)* (saturation of common variants for human height), and *[Fei_et_al_2022](https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-022-03470-7)* (with maize SLAF-Seq [raw data deposit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=PRJNA778629)).  For example, even if not used for re-analysis of this specfiic dataset, *[Kontou and Bagos 2024](https://biodatamining.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13040-024-00385-x)* provides a review (with some emphasis on analysis that considered summary statistics), and *[Hofmeister et al. 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01415-w)* is an example of a relatively recent update / development for a genetic analysis method (*SHAPEIT5*).  In terms of my individiual general research interests, I also thought *[Herniter et al. 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.01346/full)* was a good fit.  Depending upon the experimental design, content for the *R/qtl2* publication (*[Broman et al. 2019](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/211/2/495/5931111)*) may be relevant for this paper/project.  Slides with notes created during the preparation process have been uploaded as PDF files.
